# connect-square
Hi There Guys, Back with another vanilla javaScript Game. It's a 2-player game where one needs to connect 4 squares to with in horizontal, vertical or even in diagonal direction.

You can play the game at: https://rajatgupta24.github.io/connect-square/

Well currently working on it but if you have any idea considering the game please share it by creating issue or pull request.
